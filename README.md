# 06 Server-Side APIs
# Weather Dashboard

This application allows users to search for a city and view current and future weather conditions in that city. Up to 8 previous searches are saved to localStorage.

The deployed application can be found [here](https://elisesamanthadaly.github.io/06-Server-Side-APIs/). The application's GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/elisesamanthadaly/06-Server-Side-APIs/).


## Usage

Under "Search for a City," click into the search bar and type a city to search for its current and future weather conditions. The search can be submitted by hitting the "Enter" key on the keyboard or clicking the üîç button. The city search input can include any combination of lower- and uppercase letters. If a valid city is not found through the search, the user will be notified in the search bar.

Once a valid city has been searched for, its current and future weather conditions will be shown in the fields in the right column.

The user can view results for the past 8 searches by clicking the boxes in the left column.
